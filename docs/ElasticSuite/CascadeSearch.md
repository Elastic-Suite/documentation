## Technical Prerequisites

The Cascade Search relies on data collected by the tracking mechanism. If you're not seeing anything under the **ElasticSuite > Search Analytics** screen, it's likely you're having an issue with collecting behavioral data. 

You should head to the Troubleshooting section of this documentation before going further.

## Installing the module

The module responsible for neural search is `smile/module-elasticsuite-cascade-search` and this module is not part of the standard Premium package. You'll need to install it manually prior going further.
