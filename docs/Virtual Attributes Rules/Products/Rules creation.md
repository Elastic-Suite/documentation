Elasticsuite allows to streamline catalog data by creating new attributes that will be fed from existing attributes. Virtual attributes can be created for that :

First, an attribute must be created. It will contain values that will be fed automatically.
This attribute must be created using "Dropdown" or "Multiple Select" type so that options can be defined :

Then, virtual attributes rule can be created. It can be accessed under the ElasticSuite menu > Virtual Attributes Rules > via the Products entry.

The targetted attribute and the option that is going to be used must be selected
